The elements of a String are called characters. The number of characters in a String is called the length, and it can be retrieved with the String.length() method.

Given two strings of lowercase English letters,  and , perform the following operations:

Sum the lengths of  and .
Determine if  is lexicographically larger than  (i.e.: does  come before  in the dictionary?).
Capitalize the first letter in  and  and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
Input Format

The first line contains a string . The second line contains another string . The strings are comprised of only lowercase English letters.

Output Format

There are three lines of output: 
For the first line, sum the lengths of  and . 
For the second line, write Yes if  is lexicographically greater than  otherwise print No instead. 
For the third line, capitalize the first letter in both  and  and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
