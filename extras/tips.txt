1)try to minimise the number of variables use . ex- list.add(scanner.nextInt()), here you don't have to use another variable 
to take input.
2)while searching something in any data structure, use try catch block for the numbers not found to avoid errors.
3)always choose which data structure to use like for insertion deletion always use Linked List.
4)Inbuilt LinkedList class object cannot be indexed, you cannot define it's size like ArrayList.
LinkedList<Integer> list = new LinkedList<Integer>();
ArrayList<integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>(n);
5)taking input for 'int' -- scanner.nextInt();
taking input for 'String' -- scanner.next();
6)Convert the String into Character array using String.toCharArray() method.
To access Character at the specific index in an character array -- s.charAt(index)
7)for getting length of array -- arr.length
for getting length of String -- s.length()
8)when you write multiple if statements without else if ladder then don't put a 'else' case as if the
1st case is not satisfied then it will go to else part directly, though there are other parts.
9)It is preferavle not to write any code after retrun statement as it will show unreachable error.
