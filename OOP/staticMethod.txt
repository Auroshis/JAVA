1) Static blocks are executed while the class is loading that is prior to main function.
Hence if we need to check any prerequisite or initialise something we use static block.
2) Multiple static blocks in the same code is possible. They are executed in top to bottom order i.e, sequentially.
3) till jdk 1.6 without main also static function can run but after that from 1.7 onwards main is 
mandatory.
