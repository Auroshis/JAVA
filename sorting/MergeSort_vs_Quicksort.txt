1)Quicksort is useful for arrays compared to mergesort till average time complexity i.e, O(nlogn) is
considered as it does not require extra O(n) space. Allocating space also takes up time. hence only
time complexity does not determines the time taken by the program to get executed.

Quicksort does take barely O(nlogn) extra space.

2)For linked lists merge sort is better as in quicksort indexing is required frequently which is 
costly in linked lists as you have to traverse linearly

Mergesort does not take up extra space in case of linked lists.

Quick Sort is also a cache friendly sorting algorithm as it has good locality of reference when used for arrays.

Quick Sort is also tail recursive, therefore tail call optimizations is done.
